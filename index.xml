        <p>Hi, I am Obstructed Goggles, an Utrecht-based software developer.</p>

        <p>I like programming and that is why I do it. My main interests lie
        in compiler and interpreter construction, task scheduling, and
        ridiculing and circlejerking about silly ideas.</p>

        <p>I enjoy tools that give me the freedom to express my ideas,
        particularly D and Perl 6. My favorite text editor is Visual Studio
        Code. My workstation is a Dell XPS running NixOS GNU/Linux and I am a
        vivid Nix user.</p>
