        <p>Hi, I am Chlo&eacute;, an Utrecht-based backend developer.</p>

        <p>My interest lies in compilers,
        <abbr title="embedded domain specific language">EDSL</abbr>
        design, interpreters, relational databases, and task scheduling. I am
        very familiar with D, Haskell, PostgreSQL, and Rust, to name a few.

        along!</p>
